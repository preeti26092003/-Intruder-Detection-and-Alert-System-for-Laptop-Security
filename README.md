# -Intruder-Detection-and-Alert-System-for-Laptop-Security
Developed a Python-based facial recognition security system using OpenCV, face_recognition, Pygame, Pystray, and Telegram API. The system detects unauthorized users via webcam, locks the screen, plays alert sounds, and sends intruder images on Telegram. It runs in the background with a desktop tray icon for easy Start/Stop control.
